SCAFFOLDED (successfully) an entire Angular7 web app project using AngularCLI command >ng new AngularCLI01 ... 

## 2018 11 08 807a CST MV: 
EXECUTED >ng build      command    => successfully built (whatever that means in JAVASCRIPT) project :-) ... 

EXECUTED >ng serve      command  => actually "serve" ALSO BUILDS the project and launches web app on http://localhost:4200 successfully :-) ...

OBSERVED the web app running on http://localhost:4200 is a BORING, single page with NOTHING but 3 links on it (no menus, no NOTHING) :-( ...
