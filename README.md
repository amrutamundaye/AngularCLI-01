# AngularCLI-01
2018 11 08 MV: a repo for test-driving Angular CLI (v7.0.4) for the first time... 

## 2018 11 08 737a CST MV: 
ADDED line to readme.md in order to test/confirm working commit/push from local repo to cloud repo... 

## 2018 11 08 754a CST MV: 
SCAFFOLDED (successfully) an entire Angular7 web app project using AngularCLI command >ng new AngularCLI01 ... 

## 2018 11 08 807a CST MV: 
EXECUTED >ng build      command    => successfully built (whatever that means in JAVASCRIPT) project :-) ... 

EXECUTED >ng serve      command  => actually "serve" ALSO BUILDS the project and launches web app on http://localhost:4200 successfully :-) ...

OBSERVED the web app running on http://localhost:4200 is a BORING, single page with NOTHING but 3 links on it (no menus, no NOTHING) :-( ...

UPDATED readme.md... 

SAVED | COMMITTED | PUSHED | PAUSED this project for now
